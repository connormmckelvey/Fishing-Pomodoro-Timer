# Fishing Pomodoro Timer

### A Godot Desktop Game and Productivity Tool

A Pomodoro Timer designed to gamify the most dull & grueling tasks. Just like how an app like Duolingo uses digital rewards to motivate you to consistently learn a language, this desktop app creates a relaxing and strategic game that rewards you for focused work/study time.

While working/studying, your character is off fishing. When the work period ends they return and you can sell the fish you caught to buy new fishing gear during the short break.
